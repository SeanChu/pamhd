Required software:

Boost (>= 1.54): http://boost.org/

dccrg (latest version from c++11 branch): https://gitorious.org/dccrg/dccrg
dccrg has requirements of its own, see: https://gitorious.org/dccrg/pages/Install

Eigen version 3: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/

Generic simulation cell: https://github.com/nasailja/gensimcell

C++ Prettyprint: https://github.com/louisdx/cxx-prettyprint

An implementation of MPI (e.g. http://open-mpi.org/ version >= 1.6)


In order to compile and test PAMHD change the variable
ENVIRONMENT_MAKEFILE in the top level Makefile to point
to the correct environment-specific makefile or create
your own. Then run make from the top level directory,
tests will be executed automatically.
